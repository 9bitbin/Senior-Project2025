"the changes features i have did this push is

Change goal type from “Lose Weight” to “Lose or Gain Weght”
Update “Log Your Weight” so the weight change is reflected in the user’s profile as well
Change section title from “Your Goal” to “Your Weight Goal”
remaining to do is :

Update Progress in “Your Goal” section to calculate progress based on most recent weight and previous weight
“Target Value” should not be equal to current weight, user should be notified to “enter a valid target weight”
